# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
completeData = activity[complete.cases(activity),] # Removing NA values.
valuableData = completeData[completeData[,1] > 0,] # Number of steps are greater than 0
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist = hist(completeData[,1], main="Histogram of Data Without NA Values", xlab = "Number of steps")

mean = mean(completeData[,1])
print(mean)
median = median(completeData[,1])
print(median)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
plot(ts( completeData[,1] ,completeData[,3]), type = "l", ylab = "Number of steps", main = "Time Series for daily average activity pattern")
max(ts( completeData[,1] ,completeData[,3]))
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r}
na_values = activity[is.na(activity[,1]),]
nrow(na_values)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
